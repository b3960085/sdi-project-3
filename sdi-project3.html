<p>This week I continued with my mobile application theme. I continue to believe this theme should be readily adaptable to almost any example scenario. By leveraging areas such as song durations, remote server availability, and parsing selected artist details into presentable information, I was able to create a program that was easily (albeit tediously) represented in a flowchart.</p>
<p>I attempted to take the opportunity to create a pseudo data model from the JSON data as I would in an iOS app. I realized that JavaScript doesn't have classes in the same sense and I wanted to ensure that the logic I used was within the class guidelines. I feel that my final submission is a nice balance between the two.</p>
